# House Rent Prediction with Machine Learning 
In the complex and ever-shifting landscape of the housing market, accurately predicting rent prices can be a daunting task. Tenants grapple with finding affordable options while landlords struggle to gauge the true value of their properties. This is where machine learning (ML) steps in, offering a powerful tool to navigate the intricacies of rent prediction. This project delves into the fascinating realm of ML algorithms, aiming to develop a model that can accurately predict house rent based on various key factors.
